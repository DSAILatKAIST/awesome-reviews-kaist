Neural JPEG: End-to-End Image Compression Leveraging a Standard JPEG Encoder-Decoder


## **1. Problem Definition**  



However, current methods
either use additional post-processing blocks on the decoder end to improve compression
or propose an end-to-end compression scheme based on heuristics. For the majority of
these, the trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are not compatible with standard encoders
and would be dicult to deply on personal computers and cellphones.

Current compression methods are still lacking some important improvements. xx


## **2. Motivation**  

In this paper, the authors want to improve xx

### **Existing works**

Recent advances in deep learning have led to superhuman performance across a variety
of applications. Recently, these methods have been successfully employed to improve the
rate-distortion performance in the task of image compression.

 ### **Significance**
Most of the current works have xx

In light of this,
we propose a system that learns to improve the encoding performance by enhancing its
internal neural representations on both the encoder and decoder ends, an approach we call
Neural JPEG. We propose frequency domain pre-editing and post-editing methods to optimize
the distribution of the DCT coecients at both encoder and decoder ends in order to
improve the standard compression (JPEG) method. Moreover, we design and integrate a
scheme for jointly learning quantization tables within this hybrid neural compression framework.
